    <p>The Brief</br>
    The rules are as follows:</br>
    The game evolves in turns, commonly known as 'ticks'.</br>
    All changes occur at the same time.</br>
    Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours survives until next tick.</br>
    Any live cell with less than 2 live neighbours dies (underpopulation).</br>
    Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies (overpopulation).</br>
    Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction).</p>
