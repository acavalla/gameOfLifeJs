The Game of Life is a zero-player game developed in the 70s by John Horton Conway. Check out the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for a full description. The evolving state of the game is determined by the initial configuration â€” some configurations become infinitely evolving constellations, others eventually evolve into a stable patterns, whilst others die off completely.

## The Brief
The rules are as follows:
- The game evolves in turns, commonly known as 'ticks'.
- All changes occur at the same time.</br>
- Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours survives until next tick.
- Any live cell with less than 2 live neighbours dies (underpopulation).
- Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies (overpopulation).
- Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction).
